## Installation
For this stage(3) you will need to have [MWS Stage 3 REST](https://github.com/Aliecake/mws-restaurant-stage-3.git). Follow instructions there to start the sails app.

Start a simple HTTP server 
You can use [VSCode Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or [Atom's live server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)
Else, with Python 3, open directory in terminal and input ```py -m http.server 8000```  With Python 2  ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

Once your simple server is running, visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Project-Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users. In **Stage Two** restaurant data will be pulled from a new RESTful server. You will use IndexedDB to store and retrieve restaurants and maintain stage one standards. In **Stage Three** you will again being using new REST endpoints and implement new features, including favorites & forms while maintaining first two stages rubrics.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### What do I do from here?
1. Explore the provided code, and make start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
2. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
